🔍 Project Overview
This project explores how total investment risk can be decomposed into systematic (non-diversifiable) and idiosyncratic (firm-specific, diversifiable) components using real financial data.
Through Python-based quantitative analysis, the notebook demonstrates how variance decomposition works, how to interpret risk measures, and how these metrics influence portfolio construction and asset pricing.

🎯 Key Objectives
Compute total variance and volatility of asset returns
Estimate systematic risk using the CAPM market model
Calculate idiosyncratic risk (diversifiable risk) from residual variance
Interpret each component in practical finance terms
Explain how risk decomposition affects diversification and portfolio strategy
